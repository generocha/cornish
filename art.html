        <p>In 2017 I worked on the redsign of the Cornish College of the Arts redsign. The site was launched in Fall of 2017.</p>
        <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>Below are a few screen shots of the site when it launched.</p>

        <p>Modules were added to the site to keep down the need for more pages. Below is an the Facilities & Galleries module open.</p>

        <p>Every year the visual students submit their BFA work to be displayed on the bfa exhibition section. When I added this to the redesign I added the functionally to display all the past years of the bfa exhibitions. The user could click on the left and right arrows to view other years. I contacted the bfa students every year and gave them access to add, update or delete their content. All content was approved the bfa faculty before launch.</p>
