        <p>In 2017 I worked on the redsign of the Cornish College of the Arts redsign. The site was launched in Fall of 2017.</p>
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>I worked closely with the Director of Marketing on the wireframe of the site.</p>

        <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p> Once the wireframe was approved the wireframe was passed onto the designer and a psd file was sent to me to code.</p>
        <p>Below are a few screen shots of the site when it launched.</p>
