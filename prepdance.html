        <p>In 2018 I worked on the redsign of the Preparatory Dance redesign. The site was launched in summer of 2018.</p>
        <h2>Visual Redesign</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the redesign was to simplfy the site and add more media. Images for every class was added and I added the abilty to filter classes by discipline and age. I also intergrated an events page that the Preparatory admin could add, update or delete. </p>
        <p>Below are a few screen shots of the site when it launched.</p>
